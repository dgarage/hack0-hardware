# Introduction

This repository is documenting the hardware parts of the hack0.
This is made available so you can swap the parts that you want and test different setup or improve the design.

Please share your experience.

## Hardware specification

We used the [BitBox Base](https://base.shiftcrypto.ch) hardware without a case. Shiftcrypto spent considerable time testing different hardware and setup, so it made sense for us to not reinvent the wheel.

* RockPro64 4GB ([Link](https://store.pine64.org/?product=rockpro64-4gb-single-board-computer)) `79.99$`
* USB adapter for EMMC Module ([Link](https://store.pine64.org/?product=usb-adapter-for-emmc-module)) `4.99$`
* EMMC 16GB ([Link](https://store.pine64.org/?product=16gb-emmc)) `15.95$`
* Fan For ROCKPro64 20mm Mid Profile Heatsink ([Link](https://store.pine64.org/?product=fan-for-rockpro64-20mm-mid-profile-heatsink)) `2.99$`
* ROCKPro64 20mm Mid Profile Heatsink ([Link](https://store.pine64.org/?product=rockpro64-20mm-mid-profile-heatsink)) `3.29$`
* SSD 500GB PCIe NVMe, Crucial P1 ([Link](https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/ct500p1ssd8)) `66.99$`
* Shift M.2 to PCIe adapter (Link?) 0$

Total: `174.2$`

## Case specification

We noticed that building a case for this hardware is very expensive.
The rockpro64 dimension + the SSD and fan + fan size is: 133 x 80 x 40.

A quote from Japanese 3D Printers was 150$ (46% of the total price). And if the dimensions were similar to a raspberry PI, the cost would have been around 50 USD.

Our case dimension is 160 x 90 x 55mm.
* Acrylic black sheet 160 x 90 x 2 mm ([Link in japanese](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00AJEOMGU)) 4.5$
* Screws from bottom to up: [Link1](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07GPQBKFG) for `8.99$`, [Link2](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07414YZP7) for `10.00$` and [Link3](https://www.sengoku.co.jp/mod/sgk_cart/detail.php?code=EEHD-57DW) `5.00$`
    * 4 screws M3, 5mm depth
    * 4 spacer M3 x 6mm, 6mm depth
    * 4 spacer M3 x 8mm, 6mm depth
    * 4 spacers M3 x 45mm, female to female
    * 4 screws M3 Hex nuts

Total: `28.49$`

The price of screw per hack0 is difficult to calculate as we bought way more different type than we needed in order to experiment.
We estimate that buying exactly the screw you need would bring down the price of the case below `10$`.
